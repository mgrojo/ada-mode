runtest.el provides the Emacs lisp code that tests one file;
it outputs a copy of the file, indented and capitalized. It also
defines special comments that can be used to test other things.

smie/Makefile tests the ada-smie indentation engine; it runs
runtest.el against all the Ada files in ../test/*, and diffs the
result against the original. Use 'test-indent.sh' to run indentation
tests against user code.

Similarly, wisi/Makefile tests the gpr-wisi indentation engine.
