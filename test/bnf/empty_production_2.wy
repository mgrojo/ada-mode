;;; Demonstrate an incorrect way to declare an empty production in a list,
;;  for an LR parser.

;; This grammar is ambiguous. Consider the following statements:
;;
;; 1) is <empty declaration> begin ;
;; 2) is is <empty declaration> begin ; begin ;
;; 3) is <empty declaration> is <empty declaration> begin ; begin ;
;;
;; In LR parsing 3), the second 'is' causes a shift/reduce conflict;
;; shift to start the nested declaration (as in 2), reduce to the
;; empty declaration. Both are correct according to the grammar; this
;; is reported as shift/reduce conflicts when compiling the grammar.
;;
;; In the actual LALR parse of empty_production_2.input, an infinite
;; number of parsers are spawned, terminating with an error when the
;; parallel parse limit is reached.
;;
;; The packrat parser succeeds on the same input.
