This directory provides source files for testing Emacs Ada mode and
gpr mode indentation, capitalization, and other issues.

See ../build for running the tests.

The Ada files that are children of Ada_Mode were written (or renamed
from existing tests) to test the SMIE grammar while the grammar was
being written. Ada_Mode.Nominal contains structures that have a major
influence on the grammar structure, such as names with dots, extended
return, protected types. Other Ada_Mode.* test smaller parts of the
grammar. Ada_Mode.* files all use the default option settings; other
files test other settings.

Other Ada files are mostly bug reports from earlier versions of
Ada mode. They must still work, and may test corner cases not
otherwise tested.
