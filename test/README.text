This directory provides source files for testing Emacs Ada mode and
gpr mode indentation, capitalization, and other issues.

See ../build/wisi/Makefile for running the tests.

The Ada files that are children of Ada_Mode were written (or renamed
from existing tests) to test the grammar while the grammar was being
written. Ada_Mode.Nominal tests most of the grammar. Other Ada_Mode.*
test smaller parts of the grammar. Ada_Mode.* files all use the
default ada-mode option settings; other files test other settings.

Other Ada files are mostly bug reports. They may test corner cases not
otherwise tested.
