This directory provides a test of Emacs Ada mode indentation,
capitalization, and other issues.

runtest.el provides the Emacs lisp code that tests one file; it
outputs a copy of the file, indented and capitalized. It also defines
special comments that can be used to test other things.

Makefile runs runtest.el agains all the Ada files in this directory,
and diffs the result against the original. FIXME: provide a target
that users can easily use to run against their code.

The Ada files that are children of Ada_Mode were written (or renamed
from existing tests) to test the SMIE grammar while the grammar was
being written. Ada_Mode.Nominal contains structures that have a major
influence on the grammar structure, such as names with dots, extended
return, protected types. Other Ada_Mode.* test smaller parts of the
grammar. Ada_Mode.* files all use the default option settings; other
files test other settings.

Other Ada files are mostly bug reports from earlier versions of
Ada mode. They must still work, and may test corner cases not
otherwise tested.
