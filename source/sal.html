<h1>SAL (Stephe's Ada Library)</h1>

<p>Current version: 2.01</p>

<p>SAL is a collection of stuff I've found useful in my projects.</p>

<p>A large part of SAL provides a coherent set of generic abstract
data types, intended to be yet another entry in the &quot;Standard Ada
Library&quot; discussion. My goal in this part of SAL was to provide
Ada packages that take full advantage of the flexibility and power of
Ada generics, while at the same time making things relatively easy for
the casual user. See <a href="sal.html#design">here</a> for more on my
design philosophy.</p>

<p>Another large part of SAL provides math operations for kinematics
and dynamics of masses in 3 dimensional space. Cartesian vectors,
quaternions, orthonormal rotation matrices, moments of inertia,
forces, acceleration, velocity are supported, in 3 and 6 degrees of
freedom (translation and rotation). I've used this library for both
robotics and satelite simulation. This portion is partially documented
in <a href="spacecraft_math.pdf">spacecraft_math.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href="sal-2.01.tar.gz">Download the source</a> in tar.gz format. Then follow the
simple <a href="sal.html#installation">installation</a> instructions.</p>

<p>Review the <a href="sal.html#history">release history</a>.</p>

<p>SAL is copyright 1998 - 2006, 2009 by Stephen Leake, released under the
<a href="mgpl.txt">Modified Gnu Public License</a> (the same one that
covers the supported GNAT run time libraries). </p>

<h1><a name="design"></a>Design philosophy</h1>
<p>SAL grew out of my desire to provide abstract data types and algorithms that
could work with the widest possible range of Ada types. I did not want to build
a direct replacement for the C++ Standard Template Library; I wanted to see what
I could accomplish by pushing the generics in Ada as far as I could.</p>

<p>This was started in 1997, well before the Ada 2005 standard
Containers effort. The SAL design is quite different from the
Containers design; I believe both packages are useful. </p>

<p>So far, SAL does not take advantage of any Ada 2005 features,
except for 'raise .. with' and the Ada.Text_IO.Get_Line function. It
probably will evolve to use more Ada 2005 features in the future.</p>

<p>Since Ada allows abstract data types that are polymorphic or not,
and in some applications polymorphism is not desired, I provide both
kinds of data types. The child package tree rooted at SAL.Gen (for
generic) provides non-polymorphic data types, while the tree rooted at
SAL.Poly provides polymorphic data types. However, it turns out the
Poly packages are not much more useful than the Gen packages (at least
in my applications), so I stopped writing Poly packages after the first
few.</p>

<p>If the item type is indefinite, the abstract data type packages
require helper functions that do allocation and deallocation. If the
item type is not indefinite, providing these helper functions is a
chore. The SAL.Aux packages simplify that chore. </p>

<p>Here's a short list of some of the data types provided by SAL.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SAL.Poly.Unbounded_Arrays provides polymorphic unbounded arrays of indefinite types.
  <li>SAL.Gen.Lists.Double provides doubly-linked lists. Since this package is in the Gen tree, it does not
      use Ada.Finalization.Controlled (because that is tagged), so the user is
      responsible for freeing the list when done.
  <li>SAL.Poly.Lists.Double provides polymorphic doubly-linked lists, using Ada.Finalization to manage the
      list.
  <li>SAL.Gen.Stacks.Bounded_Nonlimited provides stacks of non-limited types, with a fixed maximum size.
  <li>SAL.Gen.Stacks.Bounded_limited provides stacks of limited types, with a fixed maximum size.
  <li>SAL.Poly.Stacks.Unbounded_Array provides polymorphic stacks of indefinite types, implemented with an unbounded
      array so there is no fixed maximum size.
  <li>SAL.Poly.Binary_Trees.Sorted provides sorted binary trees for indefinite limited types.
  <li>SAL.Poly.Function.Tables.Monotonic.First_Order provides invertible functions expressed as a table of value pairs,
      with first-order interpolation on lookup.
</ul>

<p>One purpose of a coherent set of abstract data types is to provide
algorithms that can be used with them. SAL has a small set of
algorithm packages, rooted at SAL.Gen.Alg. The root
packages take generic formal parameters that are common to all the
algorithms in the tree; child packages may require additional
functions (such as comparison). In one sense, it is these root
algorithm packages that define a SAL container; any abstract data type
that can be used with SAL.Gen.Alg is a SAL container.
This contrasts with the C++ Standard Template Library approach of
defining a class hierarchy, and algorithms that work with various
levels in the hierarchy. SAL does not have a common root container
type. Here are a couple of algorithm packages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SAL.Gen.Alg.Find_Binary provides a binary search algorithm on containers that can provide a
      Middle function for iterators.
  <li>SAL.Gen.Alg.Find_Linear provides a linear search algorithm on containers that are sorted.
</ul>

<p>Ada provides a wide range of types; definite/indefinite,
limited/non-limited, tagged/non-tagged, abstract/concrete. By
contrast, C++ classes can only be abstract or concrete; there are no
other choices. A C++ class corresponds to an Ada non-limited tagged
type, either abstract or concrete. This range of Ada types complicates
container packages; we want to allow the item type for container
packages to be any possible Ada type. In practice, this is not
possible, but it is possible to allow the item type to cover most of
the possibilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each package that does allocation takes a generic Storage_Pool
parameter. This allows users to implement their own storage pools, and
still use SAL. I use this capability in the tests to show that
deallocation is done properly. Unfortunately, Ada does not allow a
default parameter for the Storage_Pools, so even novice users must
provide a parameter.

  <li>Each package providing a container allows the item type to be
indefinite, and in most cases limited indefinite. This means that
allocators must be used, and the actual container type contains
pointers. To ensure that allocation and deallocation are done
properly, the container package takes generic formal subprograms that
allocate and free individual items, and uses them at the appropriate
places in the container operations. Auxiliary packages are provided
that simplify the task of providing null allocation functions for
definite non-limited types, so the one container package can be used
with the widest range of Ada types.

  <li> Access functions are provided to retrieve items from
containers. If the container is instantiated to use access types, the
access functions allow operating on items in place in containers. This
can be a problem in sorted containers; it is up to the user to resort
the container if a key value is changed. Thus SAL favors flexibility
over strict rule enforcement.

  <li>Iterators for container types in the Gen hierarchy are declared
in a child package. In the Poly hierarchy, they are in the main
container package. If the Poly iterators were in a child package, they
would have to take class-wide arguments, and they would not match the
profiles required by Gen.Alg. Container types in the Gen hierarchy do
not have this problem; keeping the iterators in child packages allows
the user to instantiate them only if needed.

  <li>Iterators generally do not contain a reference to a container
(one exception is SAL.Aux.Enum_Iterators, which provides iterators for
plain Ada arrays). This greatly simplifies declaring iterators, which
would otherwise almost always require 'Unchecked_Access (I have not
yet investigated whether Ada 2005 makes this better). On the other
hand, it means the iterator operations cannot enforce the requirement
that iterators be used with only one container. It also means the
iterator cannot tell if the container has been deleted. Again, SAL
favors flexibility over strict control. The Ada 2005 standard
Containers library makes the opposite choice; it favors safety over
flexibility.

  <li>Iterators are non-limited, so they can be copied. This can lead
to dangling pointers if abused, but it greatly simplifies writing
algorithms.

  <li>The Insert_Before (Iterator) operation has a simple meaning when
Iterator is null; it inserts after the tail of a list (which is
otherwise impossible with Insert_Before). Similarly, Insert_After
(null) inserts before the head of a list. This makes it easier to
write algorithms using these functions; there are fewer special cases.

  <li>Gen.Alg.Container_Type is indefinite, to allow more general
container types. This means Gen.Alg.Find_Linear.Sorted.Sort takes a
Temp_Container argument rather than declaring it locally. Thus the
user is forced to provide temporary storage; this gives the user
better control over memory usage anyway, so it's a good thing.

  <li>Gen.Alg supports non-limited containers, and thus requires a
Copy operation for items. When instantiating with limited items, Copy
should raise SAL.Invalid_Operation. An alternate design would be to
provide both Gen.Alg_Limited and Gen.Alg_Non_Limited; that requires
maintaining two copies of each algorithm, which is too high a
burden.

  <li>In sorted containers, the key is assumed stored in Item_Type,
accessed via Item_Node_Type. This allows for keys that are complex
functions of Item_Type, including caching.

  <li>SAL.Gen.Alg.Find_Linear.Key_Type is indefinite limited private to
support keys like:
<pre>
type Keys_Type (Label : Label_Type) is record
      case Label is
      when Muppet =&gt;
         Arms    : Integer;
         Fingers : Integer;
      when Beanie =&gt;
         Legs : Integer;
      end case;
   end record;
</pre>
This means we also require several versions of Is_*_Equal, rather than a single
To_Key.

  <li>Flexibility is emphasized over efficiency. For example, the
package SAL.Simple.Function_Tables.Monotonic.First_Order contains an
alternate implementation of lookup tables, using
SAL.Simple.Searches.Binary, while
SAL.Poly.Function.Tables.Monotonic.First_Order uses
SAL.Gen.Alg.Find_Binary. SAL.Simple.Searches.Binary uses a simple
scalar type for an iterator, while SAL.Gen.Alg.Find_Binary uses a
general iterator. The files
<tt>SAL/Source_Common/Test/time_poly_function_tables_monotonic_first_order.adb</tt>
and <tt>time_simple_function_tables_monotonic_first_order.adb</tt>
contain programs to time these two implementations. With GNAT 3.15p on
Windows 98, the Simple version is about three times as fast. For GNAT
5.04a on Windows XP, this ratio still holds. I wrote the Simple
version before I started SAL; I'm keeping it as an example of what can
be done to improve efficiency when you relax the requirement for
flexibility.

</ul>

<h1>Test code</h1>

<p>There is complete test code for each SAL package. The intent is to
provide full path coverage. Each test runs autonomously, and most
produce an output file that can be compared to known good output. Some
tests have been converted to use the AUnit framework, and do the
comparisons in the test, rather than generating output files. This was
necessary because different platforms produce slightly different
results for some of the complex computations in the manipulator
packages. As I've gotten used to AUnit, I like it a lot; there is a
SAL.AUnit package that provides useful Check functions for writing
AUnit based tests. There is a makefile that runs all the tests.</p>

<p>If you find a bug in SAL, let <a
href="../index.html#author">me</a> know. If you are up to it,
please try to enhance the appropriate test to pinpoint the bug.</p>
