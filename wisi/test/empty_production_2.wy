;;; show an incorrect way to declare an empty production in a list

;; This grammar is ambiguous. Consider the following statements:
;;
;; 1) is <empty declaration> begin ;
;; 2) is is <empty declaration> begin ; begin ;
;; 3) is <empty declaration> is <empty declaration> begin ; begin ;
;;
;; In parsing 3), the second 'is' causes a shift/reduce conflict;
;; shift to start the nested declaration (as in 2), reduce to the
;; empty declaration. Both are correct according to the grammar; this
;; is reported as shift/reduce conflicts when compiling the grammar.
;;
;; In the actual parse, an infinite number of parsers are spawned,
;; terminating when the parallel parse limit is reached. Because the
;; conflict is never resolved, no actions are output.
