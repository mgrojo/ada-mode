   --  The text in the example in the book looks something like:

   --  S' -> S
   --  S  -> L = R | R
   --  L  -> * R | id
   --  R  -> L
   --
   --  L and R are mutually recursive, so we need a forward reference
   --  for one of them. R is the simplest, so we pick that for the
   --  forward reference; the actual value is set in the body.
   --
   --  This illustrates why we require Selection.New_Selection; if the
   --  "or" in the expression for S actually looked at the contents of
   --  R, it would be dereferencing a null pointer. This grammar does
   --  not have a similar situation for sequence, but it is clear that
   --  other grammars might.
   --
   --  We must use Sequence.New_Instance, not 'new Sequence.Instance',
   --  to avoid accessibility errors.
   --
   --  Note that these must be pointers to variables, not pointers to
   --  constants; the parser stores result values in them.
