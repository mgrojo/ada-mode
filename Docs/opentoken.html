<h1> OpenToken</h1>
<p><a href="#History">History</a></p>

<h1> current version: 6.0a</h1>

<p>OpenToken may be obtained in several ways:
<ul>
  <li><a href="opentoken-6.0a.tar.bz2">source Gnu tar bzip2 opentoken-6.0a.tar.bz2</a>
  <li><a href="opentoken-6.0a.zip">source zip opentoken-6.0a.zip</a>
  <li>Debian binary package "libopentoken", source package "opentoken"
  <li><a href="http://www.stephe-leake.org/ada-france-access.html">monotone server www.ada-france.org</a>, branch org.opentoken. Maintained by <a href="mailto:ludovic@ludovic-brenta.org">Ludovic Brenta</a>
</ul>

<p>OpenToken uses Ada 2012 containers, so it requires a current Ada
2012 compiler. In particular, the current Debian stable
(Debian 7.0 "Wheezy") GNAT compiler does not support OpenToken; the next Debian release
(Debian 8.0 "Jessie") will. (see
 <a href="https://people.debian.org/~lbrenta/debian-ada-policy.html#Timeline-of-GNAT-releases">Debian
policy release timeline</a>).</p>

<p>OpenToken is a facility for performing token analysis and parsing
  within the Ada language. It supports two modes of lexer/parser
  programming; code generation similar to lex/yacc, and Ada packages to
  construct the lexer and grammar directly at run-time.

  For small languages, the Ada package approach is easy to use and
  maintain. For larger languages, the code generation approach is
  better; the grammar description is more compact, and the lexer is
  significantly faster.

  An earlier version of OpenToken provided some support for
  recursive-descent style parsing; that has been deleted, since it was
  horribly inefficient and hard to maintain.

<p>For an Ada package example, here is an OpenToken LR specification
of a typical arithmetic grammar, taken from Example 5.10, section 5.3,
page 295 of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Book_%28computer_science%29">
the red dragon book</a> (note that we have added an explicit EOF (end
of file) symbol):

<pre>
Grammar specification:

L -> E EOF
E -> E + T
E -> T
T -> T * F
T -> F
F -> ( E )
F -> integer

Ada code:

Grammar : constant Production_List.Instance :=
 L <= E & EOF                      + Print_Value'Access and
 E <= E & Plus & T                 + Add_Integers       and
 E <= T                                                 and
 T <= T & Times & F                + Multiply_Integers  and
 T <= F                                                 and
 F <= Left_Paren & E & Right_Paren + Synthesize_Second  and
 F <= Int_Literal;
</pre>

<p>This grammar is processed at runtime into a state machine data
structure, then used to parse input text. It uses dynamic memory
allocation at runtime to hold a stack of the tokens and productions.

<p>Complete code for this and similar examples is provided in the
source distribution; see the <tt>Examples</tt> directory. Equivalent
code generation versions of the same examples are also provided.

<p>The OpenToken Ada package lexer is implemented by classes of
recognizers. Each recognizer runs in parallel, and the one matching
the longest input lexeme wins. This is not as efficient as the
generated code lexer. But it is easier to use, because the recognizers
are already written, well documented, and can be independently tested.

  The generated code lexer is provided by support for Aflex generated
  lexers. This requires Aflex 1.5, which has been modified to work
  with OpenToken.

<p>Ada's type safety features make misbehaving lexers and parsers
easier to debug. In addition, OpenToken includes a trace feature, that
outputs useful information during grammar compile and user input
parsing, also aiding debugging.

<p>OpenToken is distributed under <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GPL version
3</a>, with the GNAT modification that allows use in non-GPL
projects.

<p>OpenToken was originally written by Ted Dennison. Stephen Leake
made significant enhancements. Contributions were made by Christoph
Grein.

<p>OpenToken is currently maintained by <a
href="mailto:stephen_leake@stephe-leake.org">Stephen Leake</a>. Submit
bugs directly to Stephen. Discussion about OpenToken is on the
newsgroup comp.lang.ada.

<p>OpenToken has been tested on the following operating systems/compilers:
<ul>
  <li>Debian wheezy GNAT GPL 2014
  <li>Windows 7 64 bit GNAT GPL 2014
</ul>

<p>The simplest way to use the source distribution is to install it in
the standard GNAT directories, where the compiler will find it by
default. This assumes you have write permission in the GNAT directory
tree. Then just put 'with "OpenToken";' in your project file. To
install it using a bash shell (Cygwin on Windows, or Linux), and
assuming GNAT and 'make' are in your PATH:

<pre>
cd opentoken/build/release
make install
</pre>

<p>See <a href="opentoken_developer_tools.html">developer
instructions</a> if you want to run the tests or work on OpenToken,
and for hints in case the above does not work.

</ul>

<h3>Version 4.0b 29 Jun 2010</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Packaging change to work around Debian packaging mixup; also
  changed from gzip to bzip2.
  <li>Improved this web page.
</ul>

<h3>Version 4.0a 7 Feb 2010</h3>
<ul>

  <li>Lookahead and backtracking is actually supported in recursive
      descent parsers. This required several changes:

      <ul>

        <li>Could_Parse_To is gone; the same purpose is served by
            Parse (Actively => False).

        <li>Raise_Parse_Error is gone; the message composed by the
            provided packages is already excellent.

        <li>Token types derived from Enumerated.Instance that need to
            store the Lexeme and/or Recognizer passed in Create need
            to override the new procedure Copy. This is because Create
            is called only by Analyzer.Find_Next, not by
            Enumerated.Parse; it used to be called by both.

        <li>Enumerated.Create profile is changed; ID is not needed,
            since New_Token is in out. When you fix Create, remember
            to consider adding Copy.

        <li>Token.Sequence tokens each store a lookahead count, with a
            global default.

        <li>User defined token types that do backtracking must call
            Analyzer.Mark_Push_Back and Analyzer.Push_Back to manage
            the lookahead queue; see Token.Selection for an example.

      </ul>

  <li>Fixed major bug in LALR parser generator related to which
      production gets the accept action. This bug made many small grammars
      unworkable; now they all work.

  <li>Other enhancements
      <ul>

        <li>Syntax errors reported by LR and recursive descent parsers
            include the list of expected tokens. This requires the
            Match argument to recursive descent Parse procedures to be
            of mode 'access' instead of 'in out'.

        <li>There is a dispatching Name function to allow tokens to
            identify themselves in the list of expected tokens.

        <li>The examples have been improved to more clearly
            demonstrate the differences and similarities between LR
            parsing and recursive descent parsing with OpenToken.

        <li>The OpenToken.Token.List_Mixin, .Sequence_Mixin,
            .Selection_Mixin packages have been enhanced to support
            backtracking; the non-mixin versions are instantiations of
            them.

        <li>The OpenToken.Token.List_Mixin, .Sequence_Mixin,
            .Selection_Mixin now specify actions via procedure
            pointers at run-time, rather than via overloaded
            procedures. This significantly simplifies specifying
            recursive descent grammars.

        <li>There are new examples of recursive descent parsing,
            showing that naive grammars can work, if inefficiently.

        <li>OpenToken.Token.Enumerated.Integer_Literal, .Real_Literal,
            and .String_Literal are renamed to .Integer, .Real, and
            .String, and the Value component made publicly visible.
            This allows them to be used as valued tokens in recursive
            descent parsers.

        <li>OpenToken.Production.Parser.LALR.Set_Trace is gone; use
            OpenToken.Trace_Parse instead.

        <li>Language_Lexers.HTML_Lexer supports the <pre>&lt;pre&gt;</pre>
            tag; the contents are treated as a comment.

      </ul>

</ul>

<h3> Version 3.0b 13 August 2000</h3>
<p> by Ted Dennison

<p>This version introduces recursive decent parsing. This
has the following advantages over table-driven parsers:
<ul>
  <li>It's simpler to implement.
  <li>It provides many more opportunities for reuse.
  <li>Its parsers are debuggable.
  <li>There's no expensive parser-generation phase.
</ul>

<p>The disadvantages are:
<ul>
<li>Its parsers are most likely a bit slower.
</ul>

<p>A general list of the changes is below:
<ul>
  <li>Renamed <i>OpenToken.Token</i> tree to <i>OpenToken.Token.Enumerated</i>.
  <li>Created a new (non-enumerated) base token type and base analyzer type in <i>OpenToken.Token.</i>
  <li>Made a Parse routine and a Could_Parse_To routine primitives of the base token type.
  <li>Created the following predefined nonterminal tokens (both as straight types, and as mixins).
      <ul>
        <li> List
        <li> Selection
        <li> Sequence
      </ul>
  <li> Fixed a bug in the bracketed comment recognizer.
  <li> Implemented a (hopefully temporary) work-around for a bug in Gnat version 3.13p.
  <li> Fixed a bug in the string recognizer where it was mishandling octal and hex escape sequences.
  <li> Changed the analyzer and the text feeders to support analyzing binary files.
  <li> The HTML lexer has been improved to be a bit faster and more flexible.
</ul>

<h3> Version 2.0 27 January 2000</h3>

<p>This is the first version to include parsing capability. The
existing packages underwent a major reorganization to accommodate the
new functionality. As some of the restructuring that was done is
incompatible with old code, the major revision has been bumped up to
2. A partial list of changes is below:

<ul>
  <li> Renamed the top level of the hierarchy from Token to <i>OpenToken.</i>
  <li> Moved the analyzer underneath the new <i>OpenToken.Token </i>hierarchy.

  <li> Renamed the Token recognizers from <i>Token.*</i> to <i>OpenToken.Recognizer.*</i>

  <li> Changed the text feeder procedure pointer into a text feeder
      object. This will allow full re-entrancy in analyzers that was
      thwarted by those global text feeders previously.

  <li> Updated the SLOC counter to read a list of files to process from
      a file. It also handles files with errors in them a bit better.

  <li> Added lalr(1) parsing capability and numerous packages to support
      it. A structure is in place to build other parsers as well.

  <li> Created a package hierarchy to support parse tokens. The word
      "Token" in OpenToken now refers to objects of this type, rather than
      to token recognizers.

  <li> An HTML lexer has been added to the language lexers.

  <li> <i>.Recognizer.Bracketed_Comment</i> now works properly with single-character terminators.
</ul>

<h3> Version 1.3.6</h3>

<p>This version fixes a rare bug in the Ada style based numeric
recognizers. The SLOC counter can now successfully count all the
source files in Gnat's adainclude directory.

<h3> Version 1.3.5</h3>

<p>This version adds a simple Ada SLOC counting program into the
examples. A bug with the Real token recognizer that caused
constraint_errors has been fixed. Also bugs causing constraint errors
in the ada-style based integer and real recognizers on long non-based
numbers have been fixed.

<h3> Version 1.3</h3>

<p>This version adds the <i>default token</i> capability to the
Analyzer package. This allows a more flexible (if somewhat
inefficient) means of error handling to the analyzer. The default
token can be used as an error token, or it can be made into a
non-reportable token to ignore unknown elements entirely.

<p>Identifier tokens were generalized a bit to allow user-defined
character sets for the first and subsequent characters. This not only
gives it the ability to handle syntaxes that don't exacly match Ada's,
but it allows one to define identifiers for languages that aren't
latin-1 based. Also, the ability to turn off non-repeatable
underscores was added.

<p>Integer and Real tokens had an option added to support signed
literals. This option is set <b>on</b> by default (which causes a
minor backward incompatibility). Syntaxes that have addition or
subtraction operators will need to turn this option off.

<p>A test to verify proper handling of default parameters was added to
the Test directory. A makefile was also added to the same directory to
facilitate automatic compiling and running of the tests. This makefile
will not work in a non-Gnat/NT environment without some
modification.

<p>New recognizers were added for enclosed comments (eg: C's /* */
comments) and single character escape sequences. Also a "null"
recognizer was added for use as a default token.

<h3> Version 1.2.1</h3>

<p>This version adds the CSV field token recognizer that was
inadvertently left out of 1.2. This recognizer was designed to match
fields in comma-separated value (CSV) files, which is a somewhat
standard file format for databases and spreadsheets. Also, the
extraneous CVS directories in the zip version of the distribution were
removed.

<h3> Version 1.2</h3>

<p>The long-awaited string recognizer has been added. It is capable of recognizing
both C and Ada-style strings. In addition, there are a great many submissions
by Christoph Grein in this release. He contributed mostly complete lexical
analyzers for both Java and Ada, along with all the extra token recognizers
he needed to accomplish this feat. He didn't need as many extra recognizers
as I would have thought he'd need. But even so, slightly less than 1/2
of the recognizers in this release were contributed by Chris (with a broken
arm, no less!)

<h3> Version 1.1</h3>

<p>The main code change to this version is a default text feeder
function that has been added to the analyzer. It reads its input from
Ada.Text_IO.Current_Input, so you can change the file to whatever you
want fairly easily. The capability to create and use your own feeder
function still exists, but it should not be necessary in most cases.
If you already have code that does this, it should still compile and
work properly.

<p>The other addition is the first version of the OpenToken user's
guide. All it contains right now is a user manual walking through the
steps needed to make a simple token analyzer. Feedback and/or ideas on
this are welcome.

<h3> Version 1.0</h3>

<p>This is the very first publicly released version. This package is
based on work I (Ted Dennison) did while working on the JPATS trainer
for FlightSafety International. The germ of this idea came while I was
trying to port a fairly ambitious, but fatally buggy Ada 83 token
recognition package written for a previous simulator. But once I was
done, I was rather suprised at the flexibility of the final product.
Seeing the possible benefit to the community, and to the company
through user-submitted enhancement and debugging, I suggested that
this code be released as Open Source. They were open-minded enough to
agree. Bravo!
