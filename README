WisiToken grammar mode version 1.0.0

WisiToken grammar mode provides fontification, navigation, and
indentation for WisiToken grammar source code files, using a parser.

The parser is provided as Ada source code that must be compiled; it
requires the Ada code in the wisi ELPA package, which in turn requires
the AdaCore gnat compiler and gnatcoll packages that you may not have
installed. See the ada-mode installation instructions
(http://www.nongnu.org/ada-mode/ada-mode.html#Installation) for
details on installing them.
