Emacs Ada mode version 5.1.5

Ada mode requires Emacs 24.2 or greater

See ada-mode.texi (or a compiled version) for help on using and
customizing Ada mode, upgrading from previous versions, and notes for
Ada mode developers.

Ada mode is provided as a Gnu ELPA package; to install the package,
add to ~./emacs:

(package-initialize)

then invoke M-x list-packages, install Ada mode.

Note that you must have the Emacs lisp sources installed; that's a
separate package in some distributions.

To install Ada mode, gpr mode, and associated utilities from this distribution:

Unzip to a convenient place (we will use ~/ada-mode in the following).

In a shell:
$ cd ~/ada-mode/build/wisi
$ byte-compile

Edit your ~/.emacs, add:

(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/ada-mode"))


Ada mode will be automatically loaded when you open a file with a
matching extension (default *.ads, *.adb).


By default ada-mode uses gnat find for cross-reference functions.
There is experimental support for an alternative, gnatinspect. You can
select that by adding:

FIXME: duplicates ada_mode.texi

(require 'gnat-inspect)

in your ~/.emacs, before anything that loads ada-mode

to build gnatinspect:
    (gds-lynx-5)
    cd ~/Projects
    tar xf ~/Downloads/gnatcoll...
    cd gnatcoll...
    case:
    when linux:
        ./configure --prefix=/usr/gnat-7.1.2 --enable-gpl
    when windows:
        in cygwin bash, with gnat-7.1.2 in path:
        ./configure --prefix=/Apps/GNAT-7.1.2 --enable-gpl
    end case

    make Gnatcoll_Build=Debug
    sudo make Gnatcoll_Build=Debug install


gnatinspect references:
    gnatcoll-1.6-src/docs/xref.rst
    gnatcoll-1.6-src/src/tools/gnatinspect.adb

debugging gnatinspect:
    verbosity in .gnatdebug:
    -- Projects
    -- ENTITIES.PARSING


By default ada-mode uses an elisp parser, which can be slow on large files.
There is experimental support an alternative, using the GPS parser running in a subprocess.

FIXME: move to ada_mode.texi

to build ada_mode_gps_indent.exe:

   install gnatcoll as in gnatinspect above
   
   configure GPS source
      use msys64 on Windows:
        cd /C/Projects/gps-release-ide-6.0.1-src/

        export PATH=/c/apps/GNAT-gpl_2014/bin:$PATH

        ./configure -build=x86_64-pc-mingw32

   in build/Makefile, run target 'install'
   
(end of file)
