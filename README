Emacs Ada mode version 7.1.3

Ada mode provides auto-casing, fontification, navigation, and
indentation for Ada source code files.

Cross-reference via Emacs xref can use an xref backend provided by the
gpr-query package, or a language server via eglot.

Ada mode uses a parser to provide fontification, single-file
navigation, and indentation. The parser is implemented in Ada, is fast
enough even for very large files (via partial or incremental parsing),
and recovers from almost all syntax errors.

The parser is provided as Ada source code that must be
compiled and installed, either directly or via Alire:

cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ada-mode-i.j.k
./build.sh
./install.sh

install.sh can take an option "--prefix=<dir>" to set the installation
directory.

Both shell scripts use Alire if the 'alr' executable is found in PATH.

Ada mode will be automatically loaded when you open a file
with a matching extension (default *.ads, *.adb).

Ada mode uses project files to define large (multi-directory)
projects, and to define casing exceptions.

See ada-mode.info for help on using and customizing Ada mode.
