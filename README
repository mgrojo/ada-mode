WisiToken grammar mode version 1.1.1

WisiToken grammar mode provides fontification, navigation, and
indentation for WisiToken grammar source code files, using a parser.

The parser is provided as Ada source code that must be compiled and
installed:

cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa/wisitoken-grammar-mode-i.j.k
./build.sh

This requires AdaCore gnat compiler that you may not have installed.
It is available in many packaging systems, or as a binary download
from https://www.adacore.com/download.
