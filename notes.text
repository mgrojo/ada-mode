General notes on porting Emacs Ada mode indentation engine to smie

ada-indent.el
(sal-edit-library "smie")

test/Makefile
    test/ada_mode-nominal.adb

implement semantic grammar of just block constructs to refine smie begin
    maybe semantic is fast enough in the first place; no premature optimization!
    a) if it is, drop smie :( (keep the tests)
    b) if it's not, cache the required info as text properties that smie refine-begin uses
        maintain "cache-valid-max-point"; move it back to current edit point, forward when call semantic parse.

    work in org.emacs.ada-mode.semantic
        implement ada-sem
            copy test/ada_mode-nominal.ad?

    if b), merge to o.e.a.smie
        rename ada-indent to ada-smie



refine-begin fails for:
    package begin
    local block begin after nested subprogram.
    use backward-sexp
    enumerate cases in ada_mode-nominal.ad?
        => this approach can't work; _must_ scan forward from known start, keeping a stack of block keywords
           no worse than scanning backwards to the start of the file!
           smie-forward-sexp doesn't figure out what the tokens are; need semantic!

    what does ada mode 4.01 do here?
        ada-goto-decl-start
        moves backward, using ada-search-ignore-string-comment
            ad-hoc logic, will get confused by if-expressions

    does modula 2 have this problem?
        no; no explicit block statements

"begin" as divider can only follow declarations, while "begin" as
block start can only follow statements (or "begin" as divider). Maybe I
can make the SMIE grammar keep track of declarations and statements;

variant of operator precedence parser that refines next token based on stack?

find out how to call a dll from elisp!

test/adacore_6312_006.adb
    nested begin in 'if then'
    put if then in grammar


make rest of files work
    add missing features to ada_mode-*


    aspect_clause
        record - done
    remaining statements
    remaining expressions (if expression, that started this whole thing :)
    pre/post conditions

    subprogram call with indented param list
    aggregate with associations
    nested package
    nested generic subprogram, package
    library generic subprogram
    attribute clauses
        record layout
    named associations

    look for remaining non-terminals in Annex P

then ask for input/testing
    run on my projects

specify options in .prj
    keep alist of srcdir=>.prj, apply options when .ad? file opened
        debug vs release changes .prj; check options changed, warn?

 to do later
fix indent on return

run test on GDS, with broken-paren = 2, see if anything changes

  ;; To find "(" from anywhere within an aggregate, we can use
  ;; `scan-lists'. So far, that hasn't been needed.

       ;;    ... name (
       ;;              args

switch to cl-macs, cl-lib

why are we reindenting on space?
